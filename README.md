# Day Length Analysis

Analysis and visualization code for a [blog post](https://www.aazuspan.dev/blog/chasing-summer) about how far you would need to travel to keep the same number of daylight hours year-round. `utils.py` contains a few functions for calculating daylight hours, latitudes, and Haversine distance. Jupyter notebooks for data visualization.
